# About
This project was done for COSC363 (Computer Graphics), in assignment 1. This uses the OpenGL fixed function pipeline to create a scene of an alien walking around a UFO. The implementation includes features such as:
- Planar shadows
- Spotlights on a moving object
- A sky dome
- A custom built surface of revolution
- Spaceship liftoff

For a more detailed breakdown of the project, please read the [report](https://github.com/slammywill/OpenGL-FFP-Alien-Scene/blob/099d7312d6cfb4684a95aabd9e2a3ef4a27ce447/swi126%20COSC363%20Assignment%201%20Report%20.pdf).
